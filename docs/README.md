# Iteration & processes


1. Each iteration with last 1 week and all changes activities,code, documentation, diagrams will be pushed to **iteation1** branch.
2. After each iteration will we'll release a git tag (like v1.0.0)
3. Newer iteration will continue it's development in new branch cut from previous iteration. eg. _**iteration2**_ will be forked from _**iteration1**_. This will versioning of deliveries.
4. Bugs and hotfix will be patched in the same iteration branch itself. Eg. if there's a fix to be released we'll release a new tag git tag like v1.0.1.
