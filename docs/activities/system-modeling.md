# System Modeling
The initial System Modeling phase involves creating an abstract view of the system. 
As such, a preliminary UML diagram and use-case diagram is created. 

The System Modeling of the first iteration answers the big questions related to the project requirements: how do restaurants sign up with us, how do customers track their order, which software requirements are needed to accommodate our application?
