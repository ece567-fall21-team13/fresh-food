# Software Evaluation
1. Product validation
2. Interviews of users in the beta trials. [#TODO Discuss with professor]
3. What types of transportation will each type of restaurant require (moped is enough for pizza, but not for seafood)
4. Discussion of the geographical area the app is going to cover.

The software evaulation is designed to answer two principal questions that are integral to the operation of the software. First, does the software function as planned? Second, does the software function according to user specification? The difference to these two points is critical as they are not always the same. In the software evaluation phase, it is imperative to assert that the customer has communicated their needs correctly, and if so, if they have been exectued according to plan. 

The product validation stage refers to communicating with the customer about the similarity between their vision for the product, and what was actually delivered in this iteration.

A key part of software evaluation is communication not only with the suppliers, but also with the customers. We may elect to have a 
soft beta-launch where we gather feedback on the following critical areas of the application:

1. What is the latency in the delivery time? In other words, how much does the esimated time differ from the actualized delivery time.
2. Does the position of the driver reflect the current position, or is there significant mismatch between the projected and actual position.
3. Does the restaurant selection reflect the current available options relative to what is available with other services. Is the data available on Fresh Food similar to what is visible through other delivery services?
